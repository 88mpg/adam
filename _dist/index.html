        <h1>I'm Adam Fratino</h1>
        <h3>(Yet another front-end developer with a background in design).</h3>
        <p>The first bit of code I ever learned was a CSS snippet to hide ads on an Angelfire site. Since then I've been working client-side development in the ad world to make up for it.</p>
        <p>I came to New York City to get my BFA in Graphic Design at the School of Visual Arts. I stuck around to develop scalable boilerplates for rapid static builds. I'm love pushing the limits of CSS, and Javascript is pretty fun too.</p>

      <h2>Sometimes I make things.</h2>
      <h4>I'm always trying to find some free time to work on a personal project. Sometimes I'll make something because I need it and it'll make my life easier, but usually I'll just get something in my head and see where it takes me. Most of the time the result is that I learned something new.</h4>
