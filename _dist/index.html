      <h1>I'm Adam Fratino</h1>
      <h3>(Yet another front-end developer with a background in design).</h3>
      <p>The first bit of code I taught myself was a CSS snippet to hide the banner ads on an Angelfire site I made dedicated to <strong>Calvin &amp; Hobbes</strong>, but I started feeling guilty so now I work client-side development at <strong>advertising agencies</strong> to make up for it.</p>
      <p>I came to New York City to get my <strong>BFA in Graphic Design</strong> at the <strong>School of Visual Arts</strong>. I stuck around to write code at <strong>The Barbarian Group</strong> and <strong>Rokkan</strong>. I love pushing the limits of CSS, and modern Javascript is pretty fun too.</p>

Also have an <a href="/assets/fratino-adam-resume.pdf"><strong>outdated resume</strong></a>.</p>
      <p>In case you care about my personality, I own a <strong>fat cat</strong>, I play in <strong>Skee-Ball</strong> and <strong>Shuffleboard</strong> leagues, and I want to break the world record in <strong>Tapper</strong>.</p>
